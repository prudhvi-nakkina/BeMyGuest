<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Most incoming Northeastern university freshmen tend to face a common problem of having to make expensive interim accomodation arrangements (hotels/AirBnB) between the date of their arrival, and their lease contract's move-in date.

**'BeMyGuest'** is a full-stack application that intends to provide a marketplace for leasing out rooms on a short-term/temporary basis at an affordable price to incoming university freshmen, from willing university connections who have vacancies at their homes.
